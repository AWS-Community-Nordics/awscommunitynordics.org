  <h2 class="mt-4">Equipment</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">There will be professional grade AV equipment in place on all of the stages. The speaker station will support HDMI and usb-c connectivity for the video, but you are expected to bring your own laptop to run the slides you have.
  </p>
  <a name="deck"></a>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Slide decks & Content</h2>
  <p class="mt-4">You are expected to use title slide of the AWS Community Day design reflecting the sponsors, title and date of the talk.

All talk contents and written materials should support this to enable our diverse participants to consume the content.

 <a name="faq"></a>
  <h2 class="mt-4">FAQ</h2>
  <p class="mt-4"><b>When can a speaker test the equipment</b></p>
  <p>
  Speakers can come at the venues from 7:30 on the event day. Alternatively, you should arrive 15min prior to your talk time to the appropriate venue to ensure that your own equipment is working properly. There will be someone from the organizers/venue managing microphones and other similar tech, so you need to only bring your laptop with the appropriate video connector and possibly a remote clicker if you wish to use one.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>What kind of microphones are we using</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be headset or Handheld microphones. There will be connectors HDMI + Adapters ex. USBC. Microphone use is required because of venue size, background noise and because of wanting to make the content accessible for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Is there a deadline for slides?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
      No. Make sure thought you include the slides above with sponsors reference.

  <h1 class="mt-5">AWS Community Nordics - Statement about COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5">General</h2>

  <p class="mt-5">AWS Community Nordics is a community that organizes public events, so we feel that it is in order to make a statement concerning meetup events and other public community gatherings.</p>

  <p class="mt-5">This document was last updated on <b>May 3rd, 2021</b></p>

  <p class="mt-5">
  As a general rule, meetups are currently held in virtual format only until further notice. While the special circumstances are in effect, we will have as much pan-nordic events as possible to make the best of the situation. Before considering in-person meetups, We will honor and regard the guidelines of local and global authorities and wait for the situation to stabilize while population in each respective country is vaccinated.
  <br><br>
  <b>Thank you for your understanding.</b>
  </p>
  <p class="mt-5">
  On behalf of AWS Community Nordics, <br>
  Community leads and meetup organizers

<h1>AWS Community Nordics Slack</h1>
<p>For a lot of us, Slack is increasingly becoming the place where professional communication happens. It redefines how easy it can be to communicate and network today.</p>
<p>We believe that Slack can help our striving AWS User Groups in the Nordics become an even more vibrant community:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A community where the communication continues between Meetups.</li>
    <li>A place where people can ask questions and help each other.</li>
    <li>Somewhere where we can get to know each other a little better, outside of the sometimes (for many of us) a little awkward social setup at Meetups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A genuinely good place where we support each other and have a little fun along the way.</p>
<p>Come and join us at the AWS Community Nordics Slack and help shape our community!</p>
<p>You can sign up for the <a href="https://aws-community-nordics-slackin.herokuapp.com/">AWS Community Nordics Slack here (it's free)</a>.</p>
<p>Once you're onboard, the following guidelines are intended to help you navigate our community:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go and introduce yourself in #intros. Tell us about yourself!</li>
    <li>There’s a Code of Conduct. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPgLuO9x01_zllR6_4kuKw7sVeICleKrDXiugQSF9Lw/edit">You should read it!</a></li>
    <li>Join your AWS User Group channel (e.g. #ug-copenhagen)</li>
    <li>If your favorite topic isn’t being discussed, create it! Announce your newly created channel in #new-channels.</li>
    <li>Please keep the conversations in English as we have a lot of international community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope to see all of you in Slack!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Martin Buberl</p>

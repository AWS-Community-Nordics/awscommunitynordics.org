<h2>Are you up for the challenge?</h2>
<P>
Bring your laptop and join the fun! You will be part of a local team of 3-4 people taking responsibility to keep an existing system alive and well. You will work in the console to solve tasks and challenges in a hectic way, just like you encounter when you get an incident at work. The scoreboard will update live during the event for all teams across the nordics.

AWS GameDay is a gamified learning event that challenges participants to use AWS solutions to solve real-world technical problems in a team-based setting. Unlike traditional workshops, GameDays are open-ended and non-prescriptive to give participants the freedom to explore and think outside the box.
</P>
<P>
This AWS GameDay has tasks that are suited towards people with operations, architecture or development skills - though teams are not necessarily penalized if they are not strong in all of these areas. It has a heavy focus on security and vulnerability related tasks. The GameDay implements continuous scoring, where teams can lose points while deployed infrastructure is compromised, or while things are broken. The game is designed for players with general knowledge of the AWS platform and services, as well as interest in security.

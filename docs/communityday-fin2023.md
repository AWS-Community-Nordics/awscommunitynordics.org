  <p class="mt-4">The AWS Community Day Nordics is a free full day event for AWS users to come together to network, learn from each other and get inspired. The event is organized by the community - for the community.
  </p>
  <p>
  The AWS Community Day Nordics is a cloud education event where participants are able to learn best practices and latest trends for deploying applications on AWS. The event delivers a peer-to-peer learning experience, providing the people with a venue for them to acquire AWS knowledge in their preferred way: from one another.
  </p>
  <p>
  Speakers are expert AWS users from the community - including AWS User Group leaders, AWS Community Builders, AWS Ambassadors and AWS Heroes - with real life experience in the AWS topics they are presenting.

            <b>Event-Driven and serverless in world of IoT - Jimmy Dahlqvist <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmydahlqvist" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></b><br />
            In a large IoT system, with thousands or millions of IoT devices, the load can vary heavily over the day. Data and control messages flow in a rapid and often unpredictable way. This makes these systems a good fit for a serverless and event-driven architecture. In this session we will learn about architecture patterns used, how serverless and event-driven play a central role in the success. We will also look at challenges and lesson learned during development.
          </div>
          <div class="col text-left">
            <b>The Tao of Event-Driven Architectures: a tranquil state of mind through future-proof event design - Luc van Donkersgoed <a href="https://twitter.com/donkersgood" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></b><br />
            Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) allow complex application landscapes to efficiently integrate. However, an organically grown EDA can be messy. In this talk I will present 10 simple rules to organize and standardize event-driven systems, which will help you build future-proof implementations.

            <b>Serverless Data Streaming with Kinesis and AWS Lambda - Anahit Pogosova <a href="https://twitter.com/anahit_fi" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></b><br />
            In this talk, I will walk you through building scalable, production-ready data streaming applications using AWS Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda. There will be plenty of tips, best practices and "gotchas" based on firsthand experience building serverless near real-time data streaming architectures. Together we will see how AWS services work and fail, and learn to embrace the failures. Because as Dr. Werner Vogels likes to say: everything fails, all the time.

            <b>(Re)Architecting for the Cloud by disconnecting things - Ari Palo <a href="https://twitter.com/donkersgood" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></b><br />
            Using “the cloud” is not a simple on/off switch, in reality it’s a journey; No matter if your organization is just starting the journey or already far along, this talk will provide you ideas how to "make the cloud work for you".
            It showcases how approaches like Serverless, Asynchronous & Event-Driven Systems with patterns like Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and fully utilizing the AWS feature catalogue can improve your ability to scale, secure your systems, manage cost and overall, better understand the state of your systems. The talk will also describe (and briefly showcase) how proper tooling such as AWS CDK can help.
            This talk is based on 11+ years of AWS experience in Alma Media – a European digital services & media company – that also has "the magical 5 years of experience" with technologies such as Serverless and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

            <b>Doing serverless on AWS with Terraform for real - Anton Babenko <a href="https://github.com/antonbabenko" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></b><br />
            More and more companies are adopting serverless technologies as the community is defining the best practices, tools, and patterns.
            Companies using Terraform as their infrastructure as a code tool are often required to reinvent the wheel when they work with serverless.
            In the talk, I will explain why managing serverless applications with Terraform is a good idea and how https://serverless.tf open-source project has started as an organic response to the accidental complexity of many existing tools used by serverless developers.
            I will demo a complete serverless application (including building and deploying it) using Terraform and open-source components.

            <b>Securing AWS Workloads at Scale - Nick Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/nojonesuk/" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></b><br />
            How do attackers target AWS workloads? What security controls really matter, what should you prioritize and what can be left for later?
            Using his experience assessing the security of a wide range of organizations, Nick will talk through the most common attack scenarios in cloud-native environments, and the most critical security controls to have in place. This will consider not only the workloads themselves, but also supporting systems such as CI/CD platforms and authentication brokers.
            Attendees will come away with a clearer understanding of the real-world security threats to their AWS workloads, and actionable advice on what to prioritize to make sure their data and applications remain secure.

Every customer-facing production system should be thinking about risks the system is facing. Here are some thoughts collected after running two simulations in AWS to make sure a system can recover.

            Findy Agency (https://findy-network.github.io/) is a decentralized identity agency following a microservice architecture. The agency's fully open-sourced deployment pipeline utilizes AWS CDK and GitHub tooling to offload the deployment worries from the small team. Laura Vuorenoja from OP Lab has researched the area of self-sovereign and decentralized identity hands-on for several years. Together with her team, they have developed a unique solution for applications and individuals to utilize verifiable credentials. The project includes batteries; it provides even the deployment scripts as open-source. In this session, Laura will summarize her journey in building a continuous deployment pipeline with native AWS tools. She will present an overview of the project architecture and the anatomy of their project's current CDK pipeline.

            You’ve been hearing a lot about security best practices, but you’re not convinced they can really make a difference? Do you think your resources are safe only because nobody would notice your random IP address? If so – join my session! I’ll show you real-life attack scenarios to convince you that misconfigurations can have dire consequences.

            You are woken in the middle of the night by your phone. The database has crashed and we just lost all customer data. Morning comes around and it's time for a dreaded post-mortem. Long story short, it's Human Error. The intern broke it. When we have an incident we should always strive to learn from it. Pointing the finger at individuals doesn't solve the underlying problem and people won't feel comfortable speaking up if they don't feel safe. In this session we will talk about how we as an organisation can utilise Blameless to create a psychologically safe environment for our employees as well as build a culture where we learn from incidents.

            With the latest release in the statistics on the CNCF projects, it is pretty obvious that OpenTelemetry is the recent trend in the developer community. It involves following standards about how to enable a single pane of glass to allow for visualizing traces, metrics, and logs as well as standardizing the practice of shipping telemetric data in the world of decentralized micro-service architectures. This Session will be focused on the OpenTelemetry features and how we adopt them in the AWS ecosystem to embed the practice in the workloads as composed configurable components.

            Firstbeat Technologies has analyzed over 100 billion heartbeats and created large datasets that must be re-analyzed when developing and updating algorithms. Running a new version of an analytics algorithm could take up to 4-5 days with the existing solution running on on-premise servers. Instead of a traditional lift-and-shift approach, the team devised a solution that relies on a serverless approach and massive scalability when needed. With the new solution, the team can run analytics jobs in the cloud in less than one hour, costing a few euros per run. Discover how the team used technologies like AWS Glue, AWS Batch, and AWS Step Functions to solve the analytics challenge.

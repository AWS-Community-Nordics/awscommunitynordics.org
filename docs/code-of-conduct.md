  <h1 class="mt-5">AWS Community Nordics - Code of Conduct in our Events</h1>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5">General</h2>

  <p class="mt-5">
  All attendees, speakers and organisers at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout an event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-5">
    Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free attendance and experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).
  </p>

  <p class="mt-5">
    We encourage inclusive language in event talks. A good starting point towards inclusive language is to avoid default-gendered words like "guys"/"gals"/"him"/"her" when talking generally about a group of people. A tip is to try out words like "people"/"everyone" or "the team"/"the developers".
  </p>
  <p class="mt-5">
    We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without compenstaion at the discretion of the conference organisers.
  </p>

<h2 class="mt-5">Detailed version</h2>
<p class="mt-5">
    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>
<p class="mt-5">
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
</p>
<p class="mt-5">
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no compensation.
</p>
<p class="mt-5">
    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. In larger events, event staff can be identified as they will be wearing branded clothing and/or badges. In smaller events, event organizers introduce themselves in the beginning of an event. Event staff will help in contacting law enforcement authorities as well, if situation requires taking such action with low barrier.
</p>
<p class="mt-5">
    We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events

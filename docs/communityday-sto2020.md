  <p class="mt-5">The AWS Community Day is a free full day event for AWS users organized by the community. Once a year all AWS users come together to network, learn from each other and get inspired. At this event, there will be no vendor talks, no partner talks, no sponsored talks. All speakers are expert AWS users from the Nordics - including AWS User Group leaders and AWS Heroes - with real life experience in the AWS topics they are presenting.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Date &amp; Venue</h2>
  <p>This event is being held in <b>Stockholm 2020</b>. Date and venue will be announced at a later stage.</p>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5">Sponsors</h2>
  <p>We are actively looking for sponsors. Please contact the organizers if you are interested in supporting the community and getting a chance to gain visibility amongst AWS users in the Nordics.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Agenda &amp; Speakers</h2>
  <p>Topics are chosen by the community and focus on cutting-edge AWS cloud technologies such as Serverless, Containers, Microservices, DevOps &amp; SRE, Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence, and best practices and real-world customer cases. We strive to cover all technical levels, so you can have an interesting day no matter if you're an AWS expert or just getting started in the cloud.</p>
